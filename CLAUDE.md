# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **agentes-one-shot** project - a dashboard/panel for one-shot agents using Grok 4.1 fast via Open Router. The project is currently in its initial setup phase with only a README.md file present.

## Current State

The repository contains minimal structure:
- README.md with basic project description
- Git repository initialized on main branch
- No source code files, dependencies, or configuration files present yet

## Project Description

According to the README, this project aims to create:
- A panel/dashboard for one-shot agents
- Integration with Grok 4.1 fast model
- Open Router API integration

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project without existing configuration files, the development setup will need to be established as the project grows.

## Git Repository

- Repository is newly initialized
- Main branch: `main`
- Clean working directory
- Initial commit: `d61fce9 Initial commit`

## Notes for Future Development

This appears to be a web application project that will likely need:
- Frontend framework setup (React, Vue, or similar)
- Open Router API integration
- Agent management interface
- Configuration for Grok 4.1 fast model access

The project structure and development commands will need to be established as the codebase develops.
